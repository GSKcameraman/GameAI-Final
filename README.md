# GameAI-Final

## how to run the game
You can either use the whole Unity project or the build.zip to run the game.
The camera is first locked on the agent. press "switch camera" to switch to the target view.
The target is a white sphere, move it with "WASD", and turn with "Q" and "E". 
### run the pathfinding
the pathfinding will not run automatically. you have to press "start" to start pathfinding.
And please be advised that the target position is the position of the target object when the "start" is pressed.
After the search is done, the agent will move along the path to the target location.
Please leave some room for the agent to actually move to the position of the target.
